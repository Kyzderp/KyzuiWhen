## KyzuiWhen

This is my playground for random things, most likely involving lots of chatbox spam because it's annoying to make UI.
I have no intention on ever releasing this addon as is on esoui.com, it is for unpolished code or things for my own information.
Therefore, this addon is not user-friendly: there will not be a settings menu, all settings can be toggled through chat commands, and you can see the usage by typing `/kw`
